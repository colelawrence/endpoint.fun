  h3 1. Create and save a new token
  p.
    #[a(href="/new-token", target="_blank") Create a new token] that your actions can be associated with, and copy it's value or print the page for reference.
  h3 2. Create a function
  p.
    Next, we are going to use your token to #[a(href="/new-function", target="_blank") create a function]!
    The trick to making a function is to write TypeScript which exports your function.<br>
    The following example is a great starting point!
  pre.pre-tight.
    export function greetManyTimes(name: string, times = 1): string {
      let res = ''
      while (times>0) {
        times--
        res += `Hello ${name}!\n`
      }
      return res
    }
  h3 3. Execute your function!
  p.
    Now, you should be able to see a testable page for your function!
  img(src="/k/greetManyTimes.png", alt="Greet many times function docs screenshot")
  p.
    Then, clicking on the ðŸ§ª button will enable the inputs to test your function!
  img(src="/k/greetManyTimes-testable.png", alt="Greet many times function docs with testing screenshot")
